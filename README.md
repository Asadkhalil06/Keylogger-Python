This project is a keylogger made up of Python language.
To make this project I use pynput package which use to take input.
control.py file is use as a controller for mouse movement and also get keyboard stroke. 
main.py is the actual file who listen and save keystrokes in the existence or newly created file by using open() function having parameter append.
mouse_listn.py is use to listen mouse movement to check the move location as per x and y coordinates.
keycodes.txt show all the keycodes require to remember for python.
